# Quickstart

> Welcome to CSC!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use CSC for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

* A terminal or command prompt open
* A code project to work with
* A CoStrict account

## Step 1: Install CSC

**Install globally from npm**

```
npm install -g @costrict/csc --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

After installation, you can use the csc command.

![csc](./assets/csc.webp)

## Step 2: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start CSC:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
csc
```

You'll see the CSC welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type `/help` for available commands or `/resume` to continue a previous conversation.

## Step 3: Log in to your account

CSC requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the `csc` command, you'll need to log in:

```bash
csc
# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
```

```bash
/login
# Follow the prompts to log in with your account
```

You can log in using any of these account types:

* CoStrict (recommended)
* Custom provider

### **Option 1: CoStrict Enterprise Login (Recommended)**

![login](./assets/login.webp)

> Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won't need to log in again. To switch accounts later, use the `/login` command.

### **Option 2: Third-Party API Direct Connection**

**Fill in information in the UI**

For individual users or self-hosted API services. Select **CoStrict Compatible / OpenAI / Gemini**, and fill in the following:

| **Field**     | **Description** | **Example**                |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Base URL      | API service URL | https://api.example.com/v1 |
| API Key       | Authentication key | sk-xxx                  |
| Haiku Model   | Fast model      | claude-haiku-4-5-20251001  |
| Sonnet Model  | Balanced model  | claude-sonnet-4-6          |
| Opus Model    | High-performance model | claude-opus-4-6     |

**You can also edit the config file directly**

Skip the interactive login and edit ~/.costrict/settings.json directly:

```
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com/v1",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "sk-xxx",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL": "claude-opus-4-6"
  }
}
```

:::tip[Private Deployment]

Private deployment requires the following configuration:

- For CLI usage, set the `COSTRICT_BASE_URL` environment variable before starting
- After authentication, credentials are stored at `~/.costrict/share/auth.json`, which takes priority for server configuration

:::

## Step 4: Model selection

``` 
> /model  # Start switching models
```

![models](./assets/models.webp)



## Step 5: Ask your first question

Let's start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```text
what does this project do?
```

CSC will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```text
what technologies does this project use?
```

```text
where is the main entry point?
```

```text
explain the folder structure
```

You can also ask CSC about its own capabilities:

```text
what can CSC do?
```

```text
how do I create custom skills in CSC?
```

```text
can CSC work with Docker?
```

> **Note:** CSC reads your project files as needed. You don't have to manually add context.

## Step 6: Make your first code change

Now let's make CSC do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```text
add a hello world function to the main file
```

CSC will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

> **Note:** CSC always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable "Accept all" mode for a session.

## Step 7: Use Git with CSC

CSC makes Git operations conversational:

```text
what files have I changed?
```

```text
commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```text
create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```text
show me the last 5 commits
```

```text
help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## Step 8: Fix a bug or add a feature

CSC is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.

Describe what you want in natural language:

```text
add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```text
there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

CSC will:

* Locate the relevant code
* Understand the context
* Implement a solution
* Run tests if available

## Step 9: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with CSC:

**Refactor code**

```text
refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```text
write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```text
update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```text
review my changes and suggest improvements
```

> **💡 Tip:** Talk to CSC like you would a helpful colleague. Describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.

See the CLI reference for a complete list of commands.

## Pro tips for beginners

For more, see best practices and common workflows.

### Be specific with your requests

Instead of: "fix the bug"

Try: "fix the login bug where users see a blank screen after entering wrong credentials"

### Use step-by-step instructions

Break complex tasks into steps:

```text
1. create a new database table for user profiles
2. create an API endpoint to get and update user profiles
3. build a webpage that allows users to see and edit their information
```

### Let CSC explore first

Before making changes, let CSC understand your code:

```text
analyze the database schema
```

```text
build a dashboard showing products that are most frequently returned by our UK customers
```
